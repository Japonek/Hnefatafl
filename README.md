Tafl games (also known as hnefatafl games) are a family of ancient Nordic and Celtic strategy board games played on a checkered or latticed gameboard with two armies of uneven numbers.
Most probably they are based upon the Roman game Ludus latrunculorum. I present You my version of Tablut

Setup
The game is played on a 9×9 board. Initial setup is as shown.
The king (konakis, modern Lule Sámi gånågis) starts on the central square or castle (Latin: Arx).
The eight defenders, called Swedes, start on the eight squares adjoining the gånågis, in the form of a cross.
The sixteen attackers, called Muscovites, start in groups of four at the centre of each edge of the board, in direct contact with the Swedish "cross".

Goal
The Swedes win if the king escapes to any of the fields at the edge of the board.
The Muscovites win if they capture the king.

Movement and capture
Any piece may move any number of vacant spaces in any straight line [←↑→↓], but not diagonally. (Cf. the rook in chess.)
No piece may ever pass over another piece in its path.
An enemy piece is captured and removed from the board if you move one of your pieces so that the enemy piece becomes surrounded on two opposite sides (horizontally or vertically – not diagonally) by two of your pieces. The king is also captured in this way, except in a few select cases where he is protected by the castle. A piece may be moved in between two enemy pieces without being captured.

Capturing around the castle
When the castle is not occupied by the king, it is "hostile" to all soldiers – attackers and defenders. This means that an enemy soldier may be captured by pinning it (horizontally or vertically) between one of one's own pieces and the castle.
If the king is on a square adjoining the castle (horizontally or vertically) he must be surrounded on the three remaining sides by his enemies.
If the king is inside the castle, he is not captured until he is surrounded on all four sides.
If the king is in the castle and surrounded on three sides by attackers, but protected by a defender on the last side, it is possible to capture the last defender by pinning it between an attacker piece and the occupied castle.
The latter is the only situation in which the attackers may capture a defender against the occupied castle. The defenders may capture an attacker between one of their own and the occupied castle, since the king then participates in capturing.

Moving through the castle
The only unclarity in the modern translation of the tablut rules concerns the castle. Resultantly, tablut is currently played in two variants: In one variant, the castle cannot be entered by anyone, not even the king, once the king has left it. In another variant, the king may re-enter the castle, and both attackers and defenders may pass through it but not stop in it.[35]
Warning rules
If the king should ever have an unimpeded path to the edge of the board, he must call out "raichi" (modern spelling: rájgge), meaning "opening" or "hole", and if he has two paths of escape, then he must call out "tuichu" (modern spelling. dujgu) (Cf. "check" and "checkmate" in chess.)
